                <h3 class="thirty">Why Computer Science?</h3>
                <p class="seventy">I've always known I wanted to go into the tech industry since I was in high school in Jamaica and have been weaving my path since. I have always had to urge to be a problem solver, enjoyed producing different experiences and found coding extremely interesting. As I progressed in academics, I realized that the industry continues to raplidly grow into a more integral part of today's digital age, with transferrable skills and the potential for diversity with the right development.</p>

                <h3 class="thirty">Why Do Projects?</h3>
                <p class="seventy">With the projects I've done I've hoped to put my skills on display while solving simple problems I face everyday. There are probably other solutions to these problems, but since I have the skills to solve them myself, its much more satisfying when I create my own solution.</p>
